# How to use üõ†Ô∏è

The bot will only reply in whitelisted channels.
Please add a channel to a server's whitelist using:

```
[p]ai_user add <#CHANNEL_MENTION>
```

Change the percentage of eligible messages to reply to (defaults to 50% per server):

```
[p]ai_user percent <PERCENT>
```

See other settings using:

```
[p]ai_user
```

See custom prompt settings in:
```
[p]ai_user prompt
```

This option (enabled by default) filters out responses that contains any of the following words: "language model", "openai", "sorry"
Most responses with these words are pretty generic and bias the model away from the prompt.
```
[p]ai_user filter_responses
```

Enable slash (/chat) command using:
```
[p]slash enablecog ai_user
[p]slash sync
```

### Have fun. üéâ

## Image scanning üñºÔ∏è

```
[p]ai_user scan_images
```

Image scanning, if turned on, will be very CPU intensive. Not recommended for busy servers/channels.
See below for instructions on installing the necessary dependencies. (ARM not supported)


### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```
source ~/redenv/bin/activate # or however you activate your virtual environment in your OS
pip install -U pytesseract transformers[torch]
```

OR (less recommended) run this command in Discord

```
[p]pipinstall pytesseract transformers[torch]
```

### 2. Install Tessaract OCR

See [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for instructions on installing TessaractOCR, or alternatively just use the phasecorex/red-discordbot:full image.



First time scanning an image will take longer due to the need to download the pretrained models. (OCR and image captioning models)
